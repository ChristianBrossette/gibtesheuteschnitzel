# gibtesheuteschnitzel

I have started this project and the webpage [gibtesheuteschnitzel.de](http://gibtesheuteschnitzel.de/) in 2015 during my master thesis at Saarland University. The original inspiration was the webpage [gibtesheutepommes.de](https://gibtesheutepommes.de/).

The sole purpose was to get some experience with webspaces, webpages and to have some fun. I choose and simple approach to check whether a Schnitzel is on the menue of the Mensaar. A simple regular expression is used  `re.findall(r"Schnitzel|schnitzel", content)`. This meas that other kinds of Schnitzel such as Cordon bleu will be overlooked but vegetarian or vegan Schnitzel are counted.

Not all changes to the webpage are on github since I moved the project only recently on this platform.
